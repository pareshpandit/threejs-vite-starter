# Webpack -> Vite
Gary created this marvellous starter (and youtube tutorials), forking from the Three.js overlord, Bruno.
Since Webpack has been keeping a bit behind in handling changes and depracations, causing newbies to sweat over the Boilerplate not working off-hand, this fork migrated the code to Vite for the sake of maintaining the purpose and diretion of the original repo. Plus, Vite is more fun, won't you agree? ;)

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
